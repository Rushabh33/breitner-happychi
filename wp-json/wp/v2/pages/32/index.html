Since 2014 he has volunteered his time in different roles and clubs in order to support and spread the benefits of Tai Chi and other Internal Arts. His latest role was instructing Tai Chi and 8 Brocades Qigong at Tai Chi Journey Vaughan club and at Community Centers in Thornhill. He held additional positions, such as President of Tai Chi Journey Vaughan and was part of the leadership team of Tai Chi Journey (a group of clubs in the GTA area). He also instructed Tai Chi at senior homes and various events in City of Vaughan. All of the roles that Joseph Breitner held, were as a volunteer with no compensation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in 2021, Joseph continues to follow his passion and dedication to this noble art by starting his own club. His focus is on the happiness of his students and their learning of Tai Chi, and he continues to explore new, creative and&nbsp;simple ways&nbsp;for his students to learn and absorb the benefits in a relaxing, enjoyable and fun environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For Joseph Breitner giving&nbsp;and doing good&nbsp;without any expectation of receiving anything in return is the true sense of happiness and well being. He believes that \u201cgiving is the most rewarding thing one can do\u201d, which he learned from his beloved mother and is continuing her legacy of giving&nbsp;and doing good.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\"><\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.7 -
